# APC400000
A custom remote script for the APC40 Mk1, incorporating sequencing capabilities from Ableton Push.

This is an adaption of a script by Will Marshall originally for the APC40 Mk2, requiring Live 9.2 or higher. For information on how to use the script, refer to the GitHub project page at http://martinpechmann.github.io/APC400000/.

If you have an idea for further extensions to the script, your collaboration is welcome.

Since this script contains portions of the official Ableton Push script, I include here the disclaimer for the Push script:

"Push controller script.

Disclaimer: Any use of the Push control surface code (the "Code")
    or parts thereof for commercial purposes or in a commercial context
    is not allowed. Though we do not grant a license for non-commercial
    use of the Code, you may use it in this regard but should be aware that
    (1) we reserve the right to deny the future use any time and
    (2) you need to check whether the use is allowed under the national law
    applicable to your use."
